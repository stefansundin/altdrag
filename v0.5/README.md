# AltDrag v0.5

2009-01-12:
- You can now resize windows with the middle or right mouse button.
- You can now double-click a window to maximize it.
- You can now blacklist certain windows from being dragged and certain windows from being sticked to.
- Blacklisted by default: the alt+tab window in Vista.
- Sticky-blacklisted by default: the Vista start menu orb.
- The mouse cursor will now change when you move and resize windows.
- Only one instance of AltDrag can now be run. Starting AltDrag again will make the first copy add its tray icon.
