My name is Stefan Sundin. I am a student in Sweden, programming my tools in my free time. My programs will always remain free and open source, even if I receive no donations.

Donations are a great motivation for me to keep updating my programs. They are also perfect to get my attention, especially if you want me to add some special feature.

You can get in touch with me by sending an email to `stefan[at]stefansundin[.]com`. You can also [http://stefansundin.com/ visit my website] to read a little more about me.
