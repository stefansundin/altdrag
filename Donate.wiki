= Introduction =
I, Stefan Sundin, am a student in Sweden, programming my tools in my free time. My programs will always remain free and open source, even if I receive no donations.
While you don't have to donate, donations are a great motivation for me to keep updating my programs. They are perfect to get my attention if you want me to add some special feature etc. :) But you should probably [mailto:recover89@gmail.com send me an email] first and ask if I can do it at all.
If you don't want to donate money to me, consider donating to charity instead. I have donated some of the money I've received towards charity, look at the bottom of this page.
