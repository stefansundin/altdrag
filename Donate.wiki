= Introduction =

My name is Stefan Sundin. I am a student in Sweden, programming my tools in my free time. My programs will always remain free and open source, even if I receive no donations.
While you don't have to donate, donations are a great motivation for me to keep updating my programs. They are perfect to get my attention if you want me to add some special feature. :) But you should probably [mailto:recover89@gmail.com send me an email] first and ask if I can do it at all.

= Who have contributed =

While I have done most of the work, here are some people who have contributed.

Also thanks to everyone who have reported bugs.

= How to donate =

The easiest way to donate is by [https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=recover89%40gmail%2ecom sending money with PayPal to recover89@gmail.com]. You can donate with PayPal without a PayPal account, using only your credit card. Note that PayPal will take a small processing fee.

= Donate with Flattr =

[http://flattr.com/ Flattr] is a new service that allows you to easily donate a very small amount. Visit the site and watch the video if you want to learn more. Flattr is currently in a beta stage and thus you may have to wait a long time to get an invite. If you already have Flattr, then you can flattr me by clicking this button:
