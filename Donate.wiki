= Introduction =

My name is Stefan Sundin. I am a student in Sweden, programming my tools in my free time. My programs will always remain free and open source, even if I receive no donations.

Donations are a great motivation for me to keep updating my programs. They are perfect to get my attention if you want me to add some special feature, but you should probably [mailto:recover89@gmail.com send me an email] first and ask if I can do it at all.

You can get in touch with me by sending an email to [mailto:recover89@gmail.com recover89@gmail.com]. You can also [http://stefansundin.com/ visit my website] to read a little more about me.
