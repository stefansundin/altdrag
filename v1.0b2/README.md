# v1.0b2

2013-04-20:
- Merged `Config.exe` with `AltDrag.exe`.
- Made it possible to disable the Alt+Scroll action. It was silly of me to not let you do this in beta 1, sorry!
- Added new Alt+Scroll action that changes the volume.
- You can now press the Space key during a drag to reset any custom `AutoSnap` setting for the duration of the drag.
- AltDrag can now request elevation to administrator privileges on demand, allowing for much easier elevation on autostart.
- AltDrag can now be run in multiple instances, useful if you e.g. want to use Alt+LMB to move and Ctrl+LMB to resize. See `MultipleInstances` in the ini file.
- Added experimental feature `FocusOnTyping` that moves focus to the window the mouse is hovering when you start typing. This is a new approach to the hidden X-Mouse feature in Windows. See the ini file for more details.
- Fixed issue with iTunes.
