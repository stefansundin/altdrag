# v0.9

2011-02-01:
- Added `Aero` option. Alt-drag windows to the left, right and top side of the screen. Corners work too!
- Added `AutoFocus` and `AutoRemaximize` options.
- Added `InactiveScroll`. Enable it to scroll inactive windows.
- Added new mouse actions: `AlwaysOnTop` and `Close`.
- It is now possible to toggle the maximized state with a resize button while dragging.

- Renamed "stick" to "snap" as people seem to "get" that term better.
- Fixed some bugs that prevented `HookWindows` from working properly.
