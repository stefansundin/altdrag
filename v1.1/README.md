2015-08-23:
- AltDrag has moved to GitHub.
- The installer now defaults to installing to your `%APPDATA%` directory.
  - This means it no longer automatically asks for administrator privileges.
  - **I recommend everyone to uninstall and then install from scratch.**
  - You can still install to `C:\Program Files\` if you right-click the installer and use `Run as administrator`.
- Fixed the shift key not being usable after dragging started (Windows 10).
- Fixed various minor bugs.
